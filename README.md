#An app to help me improve my rails skills

###TODO (see http://www.evankozliner.info/single/Zapcord):
* Refactoring at TODO marks (grep for TODO)
  * search.js.coffee could certainly use some work
* Friend to friend suggestions
* Reviews
* Television shows/anime
* Search isn't perfect
  * complete words seem to mess up --probably has to do with conditionals in search.js.coffee
* Stylistic changes
  * Change top bar
  * Rearrange profile card
  * Consider a total design redo once features and API are in
